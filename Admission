Before I begin, Aspirants must have qualified NEET-PG entrance exam in order to get admitted to any Medical College in India. 
Also, you must register with MCC for the consoling processes in top medical colleges and specify which state you wish to pursue MD or MS admission in.
You need to register for counseling even if you are applying directly for an MD or MS.
